[TouchPics](http://la1tv.github.io/TouchPics/)
===

**TouchPics** is (a really bad name) an attempt at recreating the tocuhscreen used on the BBC's 2013 Autumnwatch programme where you can use a tocuhscreen to:
* Choose an image from a menu at the bottom
* Rotate, scale and drag that image with multitouch
* Draw simple shapes on the image with touch

The project makes us of [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/), a multitouch Javascript library and at present is developed and only guaranteed to run on Chrome.

The progress and future plans of the project can be seen in the [plan](PLAN.md) document.
